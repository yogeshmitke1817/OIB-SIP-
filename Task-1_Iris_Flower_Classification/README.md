# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project is a supervised machine learning project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements.

Using features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, the model classifies flowers into one of three species:

- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is the famous **Iris dataset**, which contains:

- 150 samples
- 4 input features:
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
- 3 output classes (flower species)

The dataset is widely used for beginners in machine learning because it is clean, balanced, and easy to understand.
